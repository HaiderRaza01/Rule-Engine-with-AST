# Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

## Overview

This project implements a simple Rule Engine that utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to dynamically create, combine, and evaluate rules based on user attributes. The engine supports conditions based on various attributes such as age, department, salary, and experience.

## Features

- **Create Rules**: Dynamically create rules using a string representation that is parsed into an AST.
- **Combine Rules**: Combine multiple rules into a single AST, optimizing evaluation efficiency.
- **Evaluate Rules**: Evaluate rules against user data to determine eligibility.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for invalid inputs and conditions.
